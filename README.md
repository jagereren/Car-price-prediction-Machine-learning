# Car-price-prediction-Machine-learning
## In this project you'll find all the mandatory steps to finally predict the price of a used car in a test set, these are :
- Vizualisation of the dataset
- Data cleaning
- Data encoding (one-hot vectors)
- And then, the implementation of the two models of regression : linear regression and polynomial regression, you'll see which one is the best :)
